# Assembly Instructions

## Required Materials

1. Soldering Iron
2. Solder
3. BOM COTS Parts ($134.51)
4. 3mm Hex Key
5. Phillips Head Screwdriver
6. 2mm Hex Key
7. PLA
8. 20 AWG Wire
9. Dupont Jumper Cables
10. Wire Cutters
11. Wire Stripper
12. Heat Shrink/Electrical Tape

## Step 1: Electrical Wiring

Construct the electrical diagram as shown ("waveGeneratorElectricalDiagram"). The junctions indicate soldered areas/wire electrical connections. Wires that cross but do not contain a junction on their intersection do not have any electrical connection. For safety, place electrical tape/heat shrink over soldered joints. 

## Step 2: Heat Set Inserts

**NOTE: For this step, use a soldering iron tip either specifically designed for heat set inserts, or be comfortable having potential PLA contamintation on the tip of the soldering iron.**

Using M4 Heat Set Inserts (included in the COTS BOM), place heat set inserts in all of the following designated locations (images shown below). Arrows with label "1" indicate heat set inserts. 

Heat set inserts ***MUST*** be put in straight. If they are not, and screws insertion is attempted, the insert may do one of the following:

1. Surface detachment (pulled out)
2. Cross threading (destroys thread)
3. Unable to insert (either due to misalignment or angling)

### Step 3a: Insert Motor

Insert the motor as shown in the image below. Screw the motor in using the countersunk M3 screws (phillips head).

### Step 3b: Insert Carbon Fiber Rod

Insert carbon fiber rod in the designated location of the motor mount. This won't be secured, and is used for structural support.

When inserting, make sure to simultaniously insert two linear bearings as shown below. These will be used to tension the belt.
