# Assembly Instructions

## Required Materials

1. Soldering Iron
2. Solder
3. BOM COTS Parts ($134.51)
4. 3mm Hex Key
5. Phillips Head Screwdriver
6. 2mm Hex Key
7. PLA
8. 20 AWG Wire
9. Du Pont Jumper Cables
10. Wire Cutters
11. Wire Stripper
12. Heat Shrink/Electrical Tape

## Step 1: Electrical Wiring

Construct the electrical diagram as shown ("waveGeneratorElectricalDiagram"). The junctions indicate soldered areas/wire electrical connections. Wires that cross but do not contain a junction on their intersection do not have any electrical connection. For safety, place electrical tape/heat shrink over soldered joints. 

## Step 2: Heat Set Inserts

**NOTE: For this step, use a soldering iron tip either specifically designed for heat set inserts, or be comfortable having potential PLA contamintation on the tip of the soldering iron.**

Using M4 Heat Set Inserts (included in the COTS BOM), place heat set inserts in all of the following designated locations (images shown below).
